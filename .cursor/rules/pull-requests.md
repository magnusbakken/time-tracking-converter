# Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern
- Each PR should address one feature, bug fix, or refactoring task
- Break large features into multiple smaller, reviewable PRs
- Write clear PR descriptions explaining the changes and their purpose
- Ensure all tests pass before creating a PR

# Package Management

- Use pnpm for all package management operations
- Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm add <package>`, `pnpm remove <package>`
- Never use npm or yarn commands
- **Always use the latest stable versions** unless there's a specific reason not to
- When upgrading major versions, review changelog for breaking changes
- Keep dependencies up to date for bug fixes, performance, and security patches

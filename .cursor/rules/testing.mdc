# Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use industry-standard testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library, Vitest, etc.)
- Ensure tests are executed on every build
- Aim for meaningful test coverage of critical business logic
- Write tests that are maintainable and easy to understand
- Test behavior, not implementation details

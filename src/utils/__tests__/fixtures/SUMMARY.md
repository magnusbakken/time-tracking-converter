# Integration Test Setup - Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. Library-Agnostic Integration Tests
- **File**: `src/utils/__tests__/excelUtils.integration.test.ts`
- **Key Feature**: NO static XLSX import - uses dynamic loading only
- **Comparison Method**: Binary file comparison (byte-by-byte)

### 2. Test Workflow
The tests verify the complete pipeline using only public API functions:

```
readFile() → filterRowsToWeek() → transformToDynamics() → exportXlsx() → compare
```

### 3. Test Structure
```

│   ├── config.json   (Week start date and description)
│   ├── workforce-input.xlsx    (ADD THIS: Your Workforce file)
│   └── expected-output.xlsx    (ADD THIS: Expected Dynamics output)
└── case2/             (Test case 2)
    ├── config.json   (Week start date and description)
    ├── workforce-input.xlsx    (ADD THIS: Your Workforce file)
    └── expected-output.xlsx    (ADD THIS: Expected Dynamics output)
```

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Why Binary Comparison?
- Simple: Compare file bytes, not parsed cells
- Independent: No dependency on XLSX for comparison
- Future-proof: Works with any Excel library
- Exact: Guarantees 100% identical output

### Trade-offs
- ✅ **Gain**: Tests work unchanged when the Excel library is replaced
- ✅ **Gain**: No test dependency on Excel parsing libraries
- ✅ **Gain**: Tests use only the public API functions
- ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Less detailed diff when tests fail (shows "files differ" not "cell A1 differs")

## 📝 To Complete Setup

Add these files to each case directory:

1. **workforce-input.xlsx** - Your actual Workforce export file
2. **expected-output.xlsx** - The correct output you expect (run the app once to generate)
3. **Update config.json** - Set the correct `weekStartIso` (Monday in YYYY-MM-DD format)

## 🚀 Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pnpm test

# Just integration tests
pnpm test excelUtils.integration.test.ts

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch excelUtils.integration.test.ts
```

## 🔄 When Replacing the Excel Library

1. Run tests with current library → all pass ✅
2. Replace xlsx library in package.json with new library
3. Update only excelUtils.ts to use the new library
4. Run THE SAME tests → verify all still pass ✅
5. If tests fail with "files differ":
   - Manually compare the files in Excel
   - If output is equivalent, regenerate expected-output.xlsx files
   - If output is different, fix the implementation

**Note**: Because the Excel library is fully encapsulated in excelUtils.ts, only that one file needs to be updated. All other code (App.tsx, dateUtils.ts, timeUtils.ts, transformUtils.ts) will work unchanged!

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Integration test framework complete
- ✅ Test fixtures directories created
- ✅ Config files with templates
- ✅ Binary comparison implemented
- ✅ Excel library fully encapsulated in excelUtils.ts
- ✅ Tests use only public API functions (no direct library dependencies)
- ⏳ Waiting for test files (workforce-input.xlsx, expected-output.xlsx)

Once you add the test files, you'll have a robust test suite that ensures the Excel import/export functionality continues to work correctly when you replace the Excel library!
